- PHP
- Laravel framework
- Filament admin panel
- Node.js
- Vite

Dependencies:
- Laravel Framework (^10.0)
- Filament Admin Panel
- Flysystem for file storage abstraction
- Laravel Sail for Docker-based development environment (optional)
- Notification Channels (abstract-driver, ongage-notify)
- Additional PHP packages: guzzlehttp/guzzle, croustibat/filament-jobs-monitor, laravel/sanctum, laravel/tinker, rap2hpoutre/fast-excel
- Dev dependencies: barryvdh/laravel-debugbar, fakerphp/faker, laravel/pint, laravel/sail, mockery/mockery, nunomaduro/collision, phpunit/phpunit, spatie/laravel-ignition
